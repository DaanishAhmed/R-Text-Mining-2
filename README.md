Text Mining Analysis on State of the Union Addresses
----------------

This project involves using R to perform a text mining analysis on the State of the Union addresses delivered each year between 1989 and 2017.  The goal was to evaluate term frequencies and correlations between words to understand some of the most important issues facing the United States during this period.  The project has similarities with the Text Mining Group Project on President Donald Trump's Tweets, since it involves methods such as word clouds and word association mining.  However, it also incorporates additional approaches such as correlation plots and k-means clustering.

The full report can be found in the file "Text Mining SOTU Speeches.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data preparation, methods, visualizations, association mining, correlation analysis, predictive modeling, results, findings, and suggestions for future work.  Tables and visualizations are featured in the main body of the text.

There are 29 text files used in this project, with each file containing a State of the Union address in .txt format.  These files were obtained from the following source:

The R script is included in the file "text mining script.R".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file.  After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
